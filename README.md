# ScrapingWikipedia
Recuperate datas from a wiki's page 
Hello everybody,
Today, I publish my first "scraping's programm" coded in Python. It's a simple programm which recuperate data of a list of countries, and, which write in a database the link of the country and its name. As you can see it it's pretty easy, but I'm just starting to using websites with Python. You can check my prgramm adn try to run it, I work with Windows 10 and rpi4 on the last version of Python.
See u later !
